# ============================================================================
# ECCS Frontend - Main Nginx Configuration (Rootless Container Compatible)
# ============================================================================
# This configuration replaces the default nginx.conf for rootless container
# operation. The "user" directive is removed and the PID file location is
# changed to a writable directory.
#
# ROOTLESS COMPATIBILITY:
#   - No "user" directive (not needed when running as non-root)
#   - PID file in /tmp (always writable, even in restricted environments)
#   - Unprivileged port 3000 (configured in conf.d/default.conf)
# ============================================================================

# Note: "user" directive removed - not needed when master process runs as non-root
# Running as non-root is the recommended security practice for containers

# PID file location - using /tmp which is always writable by any user
# This ensures compatibility with rootless containers without needing
# to pre-create directories. /tmp is writable even in restricted environments.
